# Meal-Finder
Meal Finder SPA is a responsive web app built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that lets users search and explore recipes using TheMealDB API. It features dynamic routing, category-based filtering, detailed recipe views, and smooth, single-page navigation for a fast, interactive user experience.
The Meal Finder project is an interactive single-page web application designed to help users explore, search, and discover a wide variety of recipes from around the world. It integrates with TheMealDB public API to fetch real-time meal data, including recipe details, ingredients, cooking instructions, and category-wise meal classifications. The application focuses on creating a smooth, responsive, and dynamic user experience entirely through front-end technologies—HTML, CSS, and JavaScript—without requiring any page reloads.

The project is built using the SPA (Single Page Application) architecture, where JavaScript handles dynamic routing through URL hash changes, enabling instant navigation between pages such as Home, Categories, and Meal Details. The home page features a search bar that allows users to find meals by name, while a visually engaging hero section introduces the application’s purpose. Users can also explore meal categories from a dropdown menu or grid cards, each leading to filtered recipe results. The category pages display collections of meals with thumbnails and brief metadata, and the meal detail view provides an in-depth look at the recipe, including its origin, cooking steps, ingredients list, and a direct YouTube video link for tutorials.

The application includes a lightweight caching mechanism to improve performance and minimize redundant API calls. It also employs a clean, modern UI design built with semantic HTML and modern CSS, featuring responsive layouts, custom color variables, and card-based components that adapt gracefully across devices. The use of flexbox and CSS grid ensures proper alignment and scalability on different screen sizes.

This project demonstrates a strong understanding of front-end development, API handling, DOM manipulation, and responsive web design. It highlights the ability to build a feature-rich, user-friendly web application from scratch using core web technologies—without relying on external frameworks—while maintaining code readability, accessibility, and visual appeal.
